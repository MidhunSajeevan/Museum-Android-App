  Description: "Binoculars are optical devices used for viewing distant objects with
    both eyes. They consist of two telescopes mounted side-by-side, allowing for
    depth perception and a wider field of view. Binoculars are commonly used for
    birdwatching, sports events, and astronomy, enhancing the clarity and detail
    of distant scenes.\t"
